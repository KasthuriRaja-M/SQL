# SQL Definition

## What is SQL?

**SQL (Structured Query Language)** is a standardized programming language designed for managing and manipulating relational databases. It serves as the primary language for interacting with relational database management systems (RDBMS).

## Core Definition

SQL is a **declarative language** that allows users to:

- **Define** database structures and schemas
- **Manipulate** data (insert, update, delete, retrieve)
- **Control** access to database objects
- **Query** and extract information from databases

## Key Characteristics

1. **Standardized**: SQL follows ANSI/ISO standards, making it portable across different database systems
2. **Relational**: Designed specifically for relational database models
3. **Declarative**: Users specify what they want, not how to get it
4. **Non-procedural**: Focuses on the result rather than the process
5. **High-level**: Abstracts complex database operations into simple commands

## SQL Language Categories

### DDL (Data Definition Language)
Commands for defining database structure:
- `CREATE` - Create databases, tables, indexes
- `ALTER` - Modify existing database objects
- `DROP` - Delete database objects
- `TRUNCATE` - Remove all data from tables

### DML (Data Manipulation Language)
Commands for manipulating data:
- `SELECT` - Retrieve data from tables
- `INSERT` - Add new data to tables
- `UPDATE` - Modify existing data
- `DELETE` - Remove data from tables

### DCL (Data Control Language)
Commands for controlling access:
- `GRANT` - Give permissions to users
- `REVOKE` - Remove permissions from users

## Database Systems Using SQL

SQL is used by major relational database management systems including:
- MySQL
- PostgreSQL
- Oracle Database
- Microsoft SQL Server
- SQLite
- IBM Db2
- MariaDB

## Purpose and Use Cases

SQL is primarily used for:
- **Data Management**: Storing, organizing, and managing large datasets
- **Data Analysis**: Extracting insights through complex queries
- **Application Development**: Backend data operations for applications
- **Business Intelligence**: Reporting and analytics
- **Data Warehousing**: Large-scale data storage and retrieval

## Fundamental Concepts

- **Database**: A collection of related data
- **Table**: A structured collection of data organized in rows and columns
- **Row**: A single record containing related data
- **Column**: A field representing a specific attribute
- **Primary Key**: A unique identifier for each row
- **Foreign Key**: A reference to a primary key in another table
- **Index**: A data structure that improves query performance
- **Constraint**: Rules that ensure data integrity

SQL remains the most widely used language for database operations, serving as the foundation for data-driven applications and systems worldwide.
